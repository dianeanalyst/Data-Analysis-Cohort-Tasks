# Data-Analysis-Cohort-Tasks
This repository contains data analysis week one tasks from Data Analysis 3rd Cohort with Promise Chinonso.
# Introduction
The data used for this task is an employee data that contains 20 rows and 5 columns with the following attributes;
Eployee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job type. This is an imaginary data created by me as part of the assigned task after we were introduced to the use of spreadsheet tools for data analysis.
Activities such as filtering, text joining and splitting, conditional formatting and use of simple spreadsheet formulas were employed in carrying out this task using microsoft excel.
# Task Activity
With the data copied in two extra worksheets, each worksheet was dedicated for each of the following  listed tasks 
• Show the employees who are 'Freelancers' and highlight the ones who earn above $10,000
• Split the employees' full name into First names and Last names and highlight any duplicates found
• Highlight in Yellow any employee whose names begins with the letter 'E'. And format the Salary column  with green to red background from highest to lowest respectively.
# Sample of Raw Data

# Data Manipulation
Following the above listed task actvities, the first step I carried out in answering the question 1 was to apply filters on all columns of the raw data. Afterwards, I filtered the 'Job Type' column to show only the employee that are Freelancers and then, I established conditional formatting to highlight those earning over $10000 using green fill-in colour. See sample in the file below.

In the second worksheet, using the Text to Column feature, I splitted the 'Full Name' column in two with one column holding the first names and the other holding the last names. I went further by using conditional formatting to identify and highlight the duplicate entries in red colour. This is shown in the below file sample.
# Conclusion
Exploring the basic features of spreadsheet tool to make simple findings from data is an ejoyable activity and I look forward to progressing on this skill set in my learning journey.

Final activity for this task, was done on worksheet 3, making use of conditional formatting once more to Identify and highlight the employee names that begin with letter 'E', which I coloured in yellow. Also, Same process was used to apply 3 gradient colouring to the salary of each employee. This was done by setting guiding rules of highlighting the salaries from red to green signifying lowest to highest respectively. See the file representation below.
